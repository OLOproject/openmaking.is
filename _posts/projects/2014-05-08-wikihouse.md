WikiHouse is an open source construction set. The aim is to allow anyone to
design, download and 'print' CNC-milled houses and components, which can be
assembled with minimal formal skill or training.

Designs are shared in an open library and can be edited and combined in the
free SketchUp programme, before being automatically converted for CNC milling.
