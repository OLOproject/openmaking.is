As the world's largest 3D printing community, Thingiverse believe that everyone
should be encouraged to create and remix 3D things, no matter their technical expertise
or previous experience.

In the spirit of maintaining an open platform, all designs are encouraged to be
licensed under a Creative Commons license, meaning that anyone can use or alter
any design.
