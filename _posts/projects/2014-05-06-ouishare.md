OuiShare is a think and do-tank with the mission to empower citizens, public
institutions and companies to create a collaborative economy: an economy based
on sharing, collaboration and openness, relying on horizontal networks and
communities.

As a global community and non-profit, OuiShare activities consist of building
community, producing knowledge and incubating projects around the topics of
communities and the collaborative economy, as well as offering support to
individuals and organisations through professional services and education.
